    "MOM5 is the ocean model component of ACCESS-1.3. In this configuration the ocean has a tripolar grid. This means there are three poles, to avoid having a convergent point in the ocean. All three poles are over land points where there are no wet cells. One pole in the south over Antarctica and two in the north. What this means is that the data have coordinates `i` and `j` and the `lat` and `lon` data variables are 2D and also have coordinates `i` and `j`. The tripolar grid only starts diverging from a normal above 60N, so does not affect the calculation of Nino 3.4, but it does make it more difficult to select out the area of interest."
